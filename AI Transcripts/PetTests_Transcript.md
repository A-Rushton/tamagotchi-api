# AI Chat Transcript: Tamagotchi Pet Domain & Tests

**Date:** October 22, 2025

---

## User Prompt 1
I've written some pseudo code for some test cases in this file. Could you please write the tests for each.

---

**AI Action:**
- Planned to review the Pet class and enums to understand the API and possible values before writing tests.
- Searched for and read Pet.cs, HungerLevel.cs, and HappinessLevel.cs.

---

## User Prompt 2
2 (in response to: Should I write tests only for the current logic, or help you implement missing methods and then write tests?)

---

**AI Action:**
- Planned to add missing methods (Starve, Neglect, exception handling) to Pet.cs.
- Updated Pet.cs to include Starve and Neglect methods, and to throw exceptions at boundaries in Feed and Play.

---

## AI Action
- Implemented comprehensive tests in PetTests.cs for all scenarios, including edge cases and exception handling.

---

## AI Action
- Ran get_errors to check for compilation issues.
- Found that Pet, HungerLevel, and HappinessLevel were not recognized in the test file due to missing using statements.
- Added necessary using statements to PetTests.cs.

---

## AI Action
- Attempted to run tests, but encountered a path error due to a space in the directory name.
- Planned to rerun the test command with quotes around the path.

---

## User Prompt 3
Can you also split these tests into a more readable form by using comments for arrange, act, and assert?

---

**AI Action:**
- Refactored all tests in PetTests.cs to use Arrange, Act, and Assert comments for clarity and readability.

---

## User Prompt 4
Can you create a transcript of this in .md format

---

**AI Action:**
- Created a markdown file with the code of PetTests.cs (but not the full chat transcript).

---

## User Prompt 5
The transcript should have been of the AI chat with prompts and actions

---

**AI Action:**
- Acknowledged the clarification and created this markdown transcript, including all user prompts and AI actions, as a readable record of the session.

## Prompts and Actions

| Step | Prompt | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Add an entity for Pet which inherits the abstract entity class and include comments for the AI prompt | Entity and Pet classes were created, with Pet including Name, Age, and Status properties, and AI prompt comments. |
| 2 | Instead of Status, use separate Hunger and Happiness properties | Status was replaced by Hunger and Happiness properties in the Pet entity. |
| 3 | Both Hunger and Happiness should be Enumeration types with a value and display name for each status. Create these Enumerations in separate files and include AI comments | HungerLevel and HappinessLevel enums were created in their own files, with display names and AI comments. |
| 4 | The previous files are not in the project Tamagotchi.Domain can you add them | Entity, Pet, HungerLevel, and HappinessLevel files were added to the Tamagotchi.Domain project folder. |
| 5 | I'd like the Enumerations in their own folder, not in the Entity folder | HungerLevel and HappinessLevel enums were moved to a new Enums folder, and namespaces updated. |
| 6 | You have left the enums in the entities folder, can you remove them | Enum files were removed from the Entities folder, leaving only the versions in Enums. |
| 7 | Can i get a link to this chat to include? | Request declined (links to chat are not available). |
| 8 | Could you create a separate project for Tamagotchi Domain tests, which uses xUnit | Tamagotchi.Domain.Tests project was created using xUnit and set up to reference Tamagotchi.Domain. |
| 9 | There should be properties to also keep track of when the pet was last fed or played with, and should only be able to be set by this entity | LastFed and LastPlayedWith properties were added to Pet with private setters and public methods to update them. |
| 10 | The Feed and Play methods should increment the associated properties by 1 until max | Feed and Play methods now increment Hunger and Happiness by 1, up to their respective enum maximums, and update timestamps. |
| 11 | Add a transcript of this chat to a text file in a folder called AI Transcripts | Transcript file was created in AI Transcripts folder summarizing the session. |
| 12 | Make sure you include the prompts used | Transcript updated to include all prompts used in the session. |
